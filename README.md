euroclojure-2014
================

Hello. This repo contains the slides and other goodies about my talk at EuroClojure 2014. Be sure to checko out the presenter notes as well, they are quite extensive.

## Goodies

* git-stats: this is the generated git-stats reports about the Clojure repo activity. Just open index.html
* svn-stats: same but for the SVN (SourceForge repo). These stats are much more accurate than git-stats.
* Clojure.lisp: an extract of Clojure as a Lisp compiler from 2006
* Clojure.java: what the Lisp compiler generated when reading the standard library
* Clojure.cs the c# corresponding code
